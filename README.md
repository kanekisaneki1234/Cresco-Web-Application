# ABOUT THE PROJECT

**Cresco web-application is primarily made to facilitate the cleaning of data present in csv files. It contains methods like fillna, bfill, ffill, fillna with mean, median, mode, typecast, and much more.**

**Additionally, it also has the ability to extract tabular data from websites and files of docx and pdf formats. You can also use it to get insights on data and visualise the data into a bar, line or pie chart.**

**The web-application also provides the option to download the resultant data in csv or xlsx format. It is very useful for people who want to do quick cleaning tasks without using pandas or numpy.**
